# Rotated Template Matching


There are many algorithms to solve this problem (such as Feature2d, SIFT ..). The rotated image to be searched has become difficult to process with Match_Template algorithm.
So I searched for the template by applying all angles.
The template can be found on the main image by taking the most matching values after trying all the angles.
